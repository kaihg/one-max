# one-max
The one-max homework, with Java8.

## Max N
The max N is 62 on my Mac Air. In fact, it is the binary digial of Long.MAX_VALUE.

## Test
You can run the test to check N = 10, 20, 30.
On my Mac, it take about 35s when N = 30.
It may cost 35s * 1024 ~= 10 hours if you try N = 40, be carefully.
